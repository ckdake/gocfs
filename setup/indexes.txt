Indexing is the usage of a system assigned number or key to serve
as the primary key for a tuple. This is useful for situations where 
there may be duplicate tuples that represent differnt things and where
a relation may contain things that are hard to use as an index such
as last names and hometowns.

There are three types of keys present in our Georgia Online Campaign 
Finance System database. The first of these three are system generated 
number keys. One example of this kind of key is the Committee ID# 
automatically assigned to each committee at the time of its 
establishment. The second type of keys  are the unique primary keys 
entered by the user. For example, each candidate has a social security 
number. This is a unique number, for which no two candidates can have 
the same value. The third set of keys are primary key that are indexes 
automatically generated by the system. For example, the Officer ID for 
chairperson is an index automatically generated by the system.  All 
three types of keys are valuable to our system, and GOCFS would not 
work the same without them.

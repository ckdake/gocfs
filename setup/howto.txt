There are 4 things you need to do to add a form or report to GOCFS.
These instructions are for a form, replace the word "form" with 
"report" to add a report.


1) open up "gocfs/includes/constants.php" and add the name of your
	form at the end of the array:
	
	$form_names = array("form1",
				...
				...
				"The Name Of My New Form");


2) create a file "gocfs/dat/forms/form__.php" where __ is the index
	of your form in the $form_names array above.  Copy the contents
	of "gocfs/dat/forms/form.php" into this file to use as a 
	template.
	
	This file will be the file that the user sees when they first
	click on the form button on the left for your form. It should
	get all user input for the form, however, it can also connect
	to the database to get information if nessicary.
	
	
3) create a file "gocfs/process/forms/form__.php" where __ is the
	index of your form in the $form_names array above.  Copy
	the contents of "gocfs/process/forms/form.php" into this file
	to use as a template.   Follow the instructions in the
	template.
	
	This file is the php code that processes the user input from
	the first file you created and gathers all of the results and
	stores them in the $results array.


4) create a file "gocfs/dat/forms/result__.php" where __ is the index
	of your form in the $form_names array above. Copy the contents
	of "gocfs/dat/forms/form/php" into this file to use as a 
	template.  
	
	This file is where you take the results of the form from the
	$results array and display them to the user.  
	

That's it!  After you finish make sure to test it and make sure that 
everything works as expected.
